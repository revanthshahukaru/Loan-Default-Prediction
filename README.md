# Loan Default Prediction Case Study

## Business Understanding

Financial markets are essential to any growing economy. They help drive economic growth by channeling savings into productive investments. A major concern for financial institutions is credit risk, as improper management can lead to banking collapses.

In our banking system, banks offer a variety of products, but their main source of income is from loans. A bank's profit or loss largely depends on whether customers repay their loans or default.

Although many people apply for loans, some may struggle to repay them due to their financial situation or personal circumstances. Identifying genuine applicants who will repay their loans is challenging and prone to error when done manually. Banks face the risk of losing the amount loaned to borrowers, which is known as "credit risk."

Credit risk is the possibility that a borrower or counterparty fails to meet their obligations to repay a loan from a financial institution. By predicting loan defaulters, banks can reduce their Non-Performing Assets, making the study of credit risk crucial.

Banks need to manage credit risks at both the individual borrower and transaction level, and consider how credit risks relate to other types of risk. These factors are critical in assessing the success or failure of banking lending activities.

Research has shown that machine learning technology is highly effective for predicting credit risk. This technology leverages historical data to improve prediction accuracy.
